CRUELTY TO BOY EMIQRANTS.
Shocking Revtlsttona of Treatment
on Cansdian Farms.
Among the many grave scandals
artsing out of the systematic efforts
of tbe Canadian authorities to secure
tbe wholesale emigration of all sorts
and Conditions of people from this
country, one of the worst is due to the
arrangement by which various organ-
0:isations 0:organisations in London and other parts of
the Kingdom find situations in the
har West for young lads whom they
have had under their earn. Despite
the fact that the per sons "responsible
I take such precautions as they can
with tbe object of ensuring that the
boys shall be well cared for, it is un-
0:fortunately 0:unfortunately often the case that these

oung emigrants get into the hands
of brutal employers who trest them
ith fir.dish cruelty
Several Canadian correspondents
have written to "Reynold s" this week
enclosing reports, uken from tbe
Toronto newspapers, of the suffer-
ingt of two boys who are alleged to
have suffered grott ill treatment
while employed on farm! in the
Wett .Inspector Kinder, acting on
behalf of liarnarda's Homes is stated
to have visited Tilbury- East (Kent
County) and to have discovered that
a boy who had been placed in charge
of a farmer there was in a terrible
condition, his feet being so badly
Iroren that it was feared they would
have to be amputated, while his bsck
wst covered with blue and red welts
Another boy was st the tame time
taken away from a farm at which he
had been emplo)ed in tbe tame dis-
0:trict 0:district Hit body alto bore tignt of
ill treatment.
The authorities have since been en-
0:gaged 0:engaged in collecting evidence to enable
them to prosecute those responsible
for cruelty to the boys. One of the
lads it said to be only thirteen yean
old and was found by the inspector
out in the cold doing a man's work
on a crott-cut saw. The state of his
feet was causing him intense agony,
at the flesh was raw.
It is reported that another case of

Breese, sixteen yeart of age, who is
in the City Hospital He 1. reported
to have been nearly frozen, and his
condition it critical. It is said that
he was allowed to sleep in a barn
without proper protection from the

I elements
Naturally the greatest indignation
has been aronsed in Toronto and
elsewhere This is expressed by our
correspondents, one of whom writes
"Such ill treatment of tnvgranti m
this country is by no mean, rare
The average Canadian farmer is an
ignorant, cruel slave driver, and will
only pay a man hit wages when he
is compvllcd to do to, but the poor
bo)t who are made to relieve when
they leave the Old Country that they
are coming to a paradise toon learn
that thev have been made fools of
Ilarnardo's hornet are admirable to
a certain extent, but why to get rid
of these poor lads should they dump
them out here to lie the prey of these
Canadian savages who are worse than
Indians"

The Ontario farmers who mal-
0:treated 0:maltreated those boys will probably be
accepted by many readers of this
widely circulated British weekly as
tyiical specimens of the Canadian
farmer. Sporadic cases of this kind

thst of the Arabian fisherman who
sst on the shores of Uie Bosphorus
fishing, but in very bad luck. Ever
hear of this famous fisherman of the
Arabian Nights?
This poor fisherman was sitting
there cursing his luck, when lot be
booked a bottle, corked, sealed and
capsuled. To most people that
would have been a pretty good end to
the fishing trip. But there are bottles
and bottles. Reaching for his trusty
corkscrew, the fisherman opened it,
naturally expecting to find the usual
line of booie. But nary a drop.
From out of the neck there issued
a misty vapour which gradually took
the form of a genie of evil potency
and of a most villainous cast of coun-
0:tenance, 0:countenance, who had been bottled up
and buried under the surface of the
wster for a considerable period of
time. The fisherman found it bard

There was an evil genie round Ot-

made his way into the Ottawa nvcr
And of course everybody knows that
there has been a lone fisherman

named Borden trying to catch fish
on the banks of that stream for some
time. He may have landed tbe bottle
with the genie inside, but by his
hopes of salvation be had better not
draw the cork.

Well Sir. I am ben to prove thut
I bare not mis-atated a aingU word.
mi that I am neither a slanderer or a
ccward. Mr. Macdonald bet attained
li that mental condition wherein the
spirit of aelSahaeaa, inaana ambition
and tyranny bordering on a sense of
divine right, has become domination,
a mental condition which la never
found In any of the great men, who.
like Urn, protest to be followers of
"the Meek and Lowly One,' nor in
any of the great editor of the great
journal of the country; but it is
common among the inferior das of
clergymen la all charchea, and among
tivt Inferior editor generally. I need
not again repeat my assertions. Sir,
further than to put them In conaecu-
0:sjva 0:conaecu-sjva order, to ahow that neither Mr.
Macdonald nor the 'Glob' ha di-
0:rectly 0:directly or Indirectly attempted to meet
I Mated, first, that Mr. Macdonald
went to Washington either on hi
own personal account or aa the con-
0:fidential 0:confidential agent of this government to
conduct reciprocity negotiation.
This Mr. Macdonald technically
dealt. I re-affirm K. however, and
will prove Urn to be deceiver and
equivocate,
My next charge waa that Mr. Mac
dooald i not now paid a full talary
or for full Mm aa editor of that great
oracle of truth, tightcoosneaa and
fair dealing, the Toronto 'Glob.' but
la paid for only part of hi time by
tha -Glob'.
My third charge waa that ior.'part
of hit time Mr. Macdonald la la re-
0:ceipt 0:receipt of aalary, or expert, or rake-
0:off, 0:rake-off, or income, or eolatium. or in-
0:demnity, 0:indemnity, or consolation, or allevia-
0:tion, 0:alleviation, or balm, or any other word that
would fill the bill, from the fund

largely provided by Mr. Ginn, of
Boston, named the 'Peaca Society
Fund, auch "balm being la the form
of golden Yankee eagle, or their
equivalent. These three statement
wer made by ma first in St. Cather-
0:ine 0:Catherine on an open public platform. I
knew that there would be noma cow-
0:ard 0:coward garbed aa a 'Globs' editor, or
aome despicable colleague of Mr.
Macdonald. Imbued with the came
spirit of persecution and hypocrisy,
shielding himself behind a fire cent
white necktie and attaining notice
not by bis personal worth or godli-
0:ness 0:godliness or ability, but by the atmos-
0:phere 0:atmosphere of superstition and tolerance
surrounding him on of that fry

0:gion 0:religion into disitpute; on falling to
follow the rutxira and practice of the
Master, aa aptly put by Chaucer t

be preached.
But first he followed It himself.
one despised by every capable
godly minister of tl:3 gospel, a well
a by every honest dtisen and news-
0:paper 0:newspaper editor; I knew that some such
ignorant person would charge me
with shielding myself behind the pri-
0:vilege 0:privilege of s,rhanent. Therefore I
mad the charge; first openly on the
public platform at St Catherine,
and subsequently In the House. .Yet
I have been told that on of'tMf
tribe, no longer ago than Sunday In
the city of Ottawa, in the pulpit of
one of the churchee here, charged ma
with shielding myself behind the pri-
0:vileges 0:privileges of parliament in this matter.
I am informed that thia 1 the tarn
gentleman who, when an election waa
being held in th city of Ottawa, a
few year ago, went with hi five
cent necktie on, and pledged himself
to a member of the Conservative par-
0:ty 0:party that he waa sick and tired of the
'rascally Ross government" u Tor-
0:onto 0:Tor-onto and would do his utmost to
turn It out: yet when the leader of thia
aam 'rascally government,' the Hon.
George W. Rosa, appeared la Ottawa,
th foremost heeler in the gang who
paid honor to him waa thia same In-
0:dividual. 0:Individual.And ha would do his utmost to
turn them out. Inside of a very few
day this same" leader of that 'ras-
0:cally 0:'rascally government In Toronto.' the
Hon. G. W. Rosa, appeared on the
public platform In Ottawa, and the
foremost heeler in the gang which
surrounded him. waa thia aame indi-
0:vidual. 0:individual. On another occasion in that
aame election, in order to sell bet-
0:ter 0:better carry out the plana of the Grit
party, this individual I shall not
disgrace the aacred calling of the
ministry by calling him a clergyman
attempted to bring thia man Mac-
0:donald. 0:Macdonald. the editor of th 'Globe' from
Tot onto to preach In hi pulpit on
the Sunday before the election, so
that ha might try and convince the
congregation of the aggregation of
virtue of which that good govern-
0:ment 0:govern-ment was compoted; but to the
credit of the congregation, they re-
0:futed 0:refuted to allow Mr. Macdonald into
the pulpit. Not content with that,
thia same parson took a hat of the
members of his congregation and
marked I do not know in whatcol--Sr
how they might be influenced to
vote or bow they might be disposed
to votend he did this for the Grit
heelers of the party In Ottawa so
that they might uaa It for election
purpoeea. Thia la the gentleman who
a backing up Mr. Macdonald.
In Dante's Inferno, w are told
that In on of the oethcrrret regions
below there are a tremendous num-
0:ber 0:number of gentlemen who parade clothed
in pur and spotless white I do not
know whether they are members of
th peace society or not but they
wear a rueful aspect, th lining of
their garments ia th heaviest lead
and the road they have to travel ia
rough, rocky and jagged. These are
th hypocrite who one defaced hu-
0:man 0:human society. I sineely hope that
so great an evil will not befall thia
editor of the 'Glob.' Might I be
allowed, a a layman, to express the
wish that ha may not be found in
thia company In this nethermost re-
0:gion 0:region In the future Therefore I
would respectfully suggest that some
step be uken to reclaim himand
la that connection, I would do my
best to bring him back to what h
should be namely, an open, square
man, and have him give up equivocat-
0:ing 0:equivocating to the extent he ha been prac-
0:ticing 0:practicing that art for some considerable
tun.
